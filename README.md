Advanced Computer Architectures – Final Project Nadav Yosef-Zada 208825257, Chen Kruphman 323101311

As life evolves, DNA sequences accumulate changes over time, leading to the diversification of species and the emergence of distinct lineages. This principle extends even to the realm of viruses, entities that straddle the boundary between living and non-living. Viruses, too, possess genetic material that mutates as they traverse hosts and environments. Understanding the dynamic changes in viral DNA is paramount, especially in the case of rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses. Classifying DNA sequences of a virus into different lineages is essential for multiple reasons. It provides insights into the virus's evolutionary trajectory, aiding in tracking its origin, spread, and potential mutations. This classification assists researchers in monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines, treatments, and containment strategies. By deciphering the intricacies of DNA lineages within viruses, scientists gain a crucial vantage point to combat emerging threats and safeguard global health.

Our Project:
We will classify SARS-COV-19’s genomic sequences to different existing lineages, using 2 CNN models:
1. CNN
2. CNN with Embedding layer
3. CNN using forward-forward algorithm
   
We will compare the results of those networks.
